NOTE: You will see linked repo's in this repo, the one you want (The one that is deployed right now) is anything under /exampleRestAPI/

This is a private node API that handes HTTP requests for the autoclip app to Create, Read, Update, and Delete information from a postgres database while scaling well and maintaining state

Later on in the summer once we get the web component of our app working this will likely also handle our websites CRUD needs
